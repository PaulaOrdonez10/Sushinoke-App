## Project Overview

This personal project, **Sushinoke Sushi Express**, is a sushi ordering app built with Microsoft tools such as **SharePoint**, **Power Apps**, **Power Automate**, and **Power BI** to create a seamless and efficient sushi ordering experience for customers.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this app is to create a simple, fast, and intuitive way for customers to order sushi, and for the business to easily track customer orders, popular dishes, peak ordering times, and total revenue. This app improves operational efficiency by automating the ordering process, sending confirmation emails, and providing real-time data insights through dashboards.

### Key Technologies Used

- **SharePoint:** Created two databases: one for product entries and another for customer orders, including details such as quantity, price, and total.

- **Power Apps:** Designed an easy-to-use app where customers can select their sushi items. Once the "Save Order" button is pressed, the order is processed via Power Automate.

- **Power Automate:** Automated the process of sending order confirmation emails using Outlook and updating the database with the latest order details.
- **Power BI:** Connected the orders database to Power BI to generate a dashboard with insights on most popular dishes, peak ordering times, and total revenue.

### Steps Followed

- **Step 1:** Created two SharePoint databases: one for sushi product entries and one for customer orders.
- **Step 2:** Developed the **Sushinoke** app in **Power Apps** for customers to select sushi items and submit orders.
- **Step 3:** Implemented **Power Automate** to send order details via email once the order is placed.
- **Step 4:** Collected all order data in the SharePoint "Orders" database.
- **Step 5:** Connected the SharePoint "Orders" database to **Power BI** and created a dashboard to analyze key metrics:
  - Most popular sushi dishes
  - Peak ordering times and days
  - Total revenue
  - Customer order details (items, quantities, total spend)

### Insights from the Dashboard

Using Power BI, I created a dashboard to track the following:

- **Most Popular Dishes**: Visualized the sushi items that are ordered the most.
- **Peak Ordering Times**: Identified the times and days when orders are most frequent.
- **Total Revenue**: Tracked the total sales based on customer orders.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyzed the details of customer orders, including quantity and spending patterns.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing a feedback feature where customers can rate their orders.
- Expanding the app to include more categories, such as beverages or side dishes.
- Improving the UI/UX design for a better customer experience.

## Inspiration

I found inspiration for this project from a friend who is starting a sushi business. I enjoyed collaborating and learning new tools to help bring this project to life, with the goal of improving operational efficiency for small businesses.
